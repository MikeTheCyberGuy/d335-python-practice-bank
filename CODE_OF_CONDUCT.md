# Code of Conduct – D335 Python Practice Bank

This repository exists to help students get **extra practice** with Python concepts similar to those found in an intro programming / CS fundamentals course. It is **not** a place to share, trade, or distribute answers to graded work.

By using or contributing to this repository, you agree to follow the guidelines below.

---

## 1. Purpose of this repository

This repo is for:

- Practicing Python skills (file I/O, lists, types, conditionals, etc.).
- Sharing self-contained practice problems.
- Sharing **your own** explanations, walkthroughs, and learning resources.

This repo is **not** for:

- Sharing answers or code for **graded assignments**, **exams**, **performance assessments**, or any other official evaluation.
- Posting or mirroring official course materials that are not meant to be publicly redistributed.

---

## 2. Academic integrity

To protect everyone involved (including you), the following are **not allowed**:

- Uploading or sharing:
  - Exact exam questions
  - Graded assignment prompts
  - Project descriptions that are part of an active or locked assessment
  - Official answer keys or instructor solutions
- Posting full solutions to **current** graded work from any course.
- Asking for or providing “just give me the code” answers to active exams/assessments.
- Using this repo to cheat or help others cheat on coursework.

If you are unsure whether something is okay to share, assume **it is not** and leave it out.

This repository is for **practice-style** problems and **original** drills only.

---

## 3. Acceptable contributions

Examples of what **is** welcome here:

- New practice problems in the same spirit as the existing ones.
- Alternative solutions to the practice problems in this repo.
- Explanations of how a concept works (e.g., how `open()`, `readlines()`, `try/except`, `type().__name__`, etc. behave).
- Improvements to existing exercises:
  - Clearer instructions
  - More robust input handling
  - Better comments or structure

When in doubt, keep contributions:

- **Original** (your own wording and code)
- **Practice-oriented**, not graded-work-oriented

---

## 4. Respectful behavior

Even though this is a small practice repo, basic community rules still apply:

- Be respectful and constructive in Issues and Discussions.
- Assume people are here to learn, not to show off.
- Don’t insult, harass, or attack other users.
- Keep language reasonably professional; swearing at bugs is fine, swearing at people is not.

---

## 5. Enforcement

The maintainer(s) of this repository may:

- Remove content that violates this code of conduct.
- Close pull requests or discussions that involve exam/assessment content or cheating.
- Block users who repeatedly ignore these rules.
- If necessary, cooperate with an institution’s academic integrity process if obvious cheating is being facilitated.

If you see something that you believe violates this Code of Conduct, please:

- Open an Issue marked clearly (e.g., `Possible academic integrity issue`), **or**
- Contact the maintainer privately if you prefer (e.g., via GitHub profile contact info).

---

## 6. Reminder

This repo is a **practice tool**, not an answer key.

Use it to get better at Python, not to bypass doing your own work. In the long run, the practice will help you far more than any copied solution.
